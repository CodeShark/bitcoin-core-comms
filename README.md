Communications & Outreach for Bitcoin Core

Bitcoin Core is an open source software project focused on developing for the current version of the Bitcoin protocol. The communications, outreach, and education resources of Core will exist in the same way: an open system where everyone collaborates transparently and can directly contribute without barrier to entry.

Through applying swarm methodologies in communications it's entirely possible to build an open source communication operation, empowering the community to contribute in the same way it has contributed in developing code for Bitcoin.  

This repository aims to collect graphics, best practices, templates and any materials or content appropriate to Core's communication efforts.
